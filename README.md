# Pick a Place

Here you can find iPhyton notebooks, detailing my data exploration of the project, analysis, and plans. 

The slides for the project you can find at http://slides.com/aleksandravillepique/deck#/

Below are individual notebooks with the short explanation what is in them.

**PreliminaryExploratoryAnalysis** -  a brief overview of my first exploration of the dataset to see is it appropriate for answering my question. 

**ExploratoryAnalysis** - more dwelling into a problem. 

**SeakPeak** - looking is there a connection between demographic info and popularity of different business categories.

Unfortunately, now I had to change direction in the analysis. Census data, encompassing all variables I deem useful, does not have enough resolution to answer truly which exact location would be suitable for which type of the business. Thus, I decided to continue my research using only Yelp data. This means that the whole approach to the problem is slightly changed. 

**Clustering algorithm** - My explanation of why DBSCAN is more suitable for use in a geographical application. View it here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/AlexandraVillepique/InsightProject/blob/master/Clustering%20Algorithms%20.ipynb

**Phoenix_AZ** - Clustering applied on Phoenix. View it here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/AlexandraVillepique/InsightProject/blob/master/Phoenix_AZ.ipynb

**New Variable - Location Quotient** - I had to develop a new variable to deal with varying volume of visitors to different areas of the city. 

**Analysis** -detailed analysis with the result and  map plots. View it here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/AlexandraVillepique/InsightProject/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb

**SteamlinedAnalysis** - just a part of an analysis that is crucial for picking a location based on Location Quotient. View it here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/AlexandraVillepique/InsightProject/blob/master/SteamlinedAnalysis.ipynb

**Pittsburgh_PA** - what is happening in this city?
